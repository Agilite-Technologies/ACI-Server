# ACI-Server
A minimalistic node server that provides .aci files for rkt discovery.

Note that this program is under heavy development and not ready for deployment yet!

## How it works
This server runs behind an existing webserver and provides .aci images.
It provides the links necessary for ac-discovery.

## Start server
```bash
$ node app.js you.domain.com
```
